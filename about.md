Hi there!
I am Vivek Kalyan, second year student at SUTD. I am majoring in Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD) and am planning to specialize in Machine Learning/AI.

I love making things and exploring with new technology. For example, the image is a 3D model of me scanned by a attaching a Kinect to a KUKA industrial robot and writing a script to move its arm in an arc around my body.

I have experience building a variety of applications from a full backend content management system for a startup in France to an iOS and Android application for SUTD admissions office. I am currently exploring the areas of artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles.

When I am not in front of my laptop, I can be found on the field playing soccer. I am the Vice President of SUTD's Soccer team and also participate regularly with a sunday league team.
