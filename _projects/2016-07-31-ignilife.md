I interned for 3 months at [Ignilife](http://www.ignilife.com/) in Sophia Antipolis, France. Their previous content management system (CMS) solution, WordPress, was not able to create interactive content that their content creators had to create. As such, I was to build a full CMS from scratch.

I wrote the web application using **Django**, a python framework. The frontend was a mixture of **HTML**, **CSS** and **jQuery**. The application had to be operational by the end of 3 months, and having no prior experience with Django, I had to learn rapidly on the job. Despite being in a foreign country, I was able to communicate effectively with my project manager to ensure that the project met the specifications. The CMS had a RESTful API endpoint which was accessed by the consumer facing application. Thus, I also had to write clear documentation on the usage of the API. 

I was able to produce the CMS faster than anticipated and thus set up a continuous integration system for deployment. Using **Jenkins** and **Ansible** to automate the process, the system was able to set up the required configurations of gunicorn, nginx and supervisor. It would then build and deploy to AWS.
