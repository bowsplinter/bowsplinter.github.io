I interned for 3 months at [Ignilife](http://www.ignilife.com/), a health-tech startup, in Sophia Antipolis, France. Their previous content management system (CMS) solution, WordPress, was not able to create the interactive content that their content creators wanted to create. I was tasked with researching the best way to create a new CMS that met the demands of the company.

I implemented the web application using Django, a **Python** backend framework. The frontend was a mixture of HTML, CSS and jQuery. The CMS had to be live in 3 months, and despite having no prior experience with web applications, I learnt rapidly on the job to deliver the project on time. Despite being in a foreign country, I was able to communicate effectively with my project manager to ensure that the project met the requirements. The CMS had a REST API endpoint which was accessed by the consumer facing applications. I wrote clear documentation on the usage of the API, such that the developers of the consumer facing applications could easily interface with the CMS to fetch the required content.

Some screenshots of the CMS:

The CMS was also to be used by language translators to translate the available content. I created a simple and intuitive workflow which allowed the translators to effortlessly focus on just the translation. This allowed them to quickly translate texts, which reduced the cost to the company. To increase productivity, I set up a continuous integration system for deployment. Using **Jenkins** and **Ansible** to automate the process, the system was able to set up the required configurations of gunicorn, nginx and supervisor. It would build, run tests and upload the application to AWS. This heavily reduced the time required for deployment.

The CMS is currently used in production by the company for their content managers.
