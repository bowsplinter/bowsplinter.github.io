exploreSUTD is a mobile application developed for SUTD Admissions Office, as part of their efforts to outreach to incoming students. It aims to create an engaging experience for students, allowing them to make an informed decision on their choice of university. 

exploreSUTD targets both iOS and android platforms. It is built using [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/), an **Angular JS** framework for building cross-platform applications using Cordova. The application has 3 major features.

### Map

The first is a map of SUTD's campus. Interesting locations are shown as pins. Clicking on the pins reveal useful information generated by current students. By using the phone's geolocation services, the app is able to tell when the user is physically at the location, upon which users are allowed to 'collect the location'. Upon collecting a set number of locations, they can redeem them for merchandise from the admin office.

The map also contains 'secret' locations. These locations do not appear as pins on the map, but rather present themselves to users who are nearby. Using the phone's geofencing capabilities, a notification is pushed to the user when the user is at the secret location. Because the applications uses the phone's native functionality, the push notification works even when the application is not running.

### Events

The second is a calendar with upcoming events organised by school. The calendar allows users to save events to their phone's calendar, share the events with friends and also receive push notifications of upcoming events.

To facilitate ease of updating events, a **Ruby on Rails** powered content management system (CMS) was created for administrators to easily create events. In the CMS, administrators are able create, edit and delete events. They are also able to choose when the push notifications for the events are to be triggered (eg. 1 day before the event).

### Info

The last is an information section, with information taken from the sutd website regarding applications to SUTD. It also curates interesting SUTD related feeds and news and presents it to the user in a readable manner.

### Product Video
