exploreSUTD is a mobile application developed for SUTD Admissions Office. It targets potential students, giving them information to make an informed choice. We built the application using Ionic, an **Angular JS** framework.

Aiming to engage students, exploreSUTD has a Pokemon GO-esque feature. Students can explore the school, collecting collectibles which can be redeemed for prizes. It uses geofencing to track the location of the students.

exploreSUTD also curates student-driven Facebook feeds and blogs, presenting them in a readable manner. Students are able to sync events to their phone and reminders will be sent for upcoming events.

We pitched for and won the contract to develop the application. This was our product video:

exploreSUTD will be released to the public during SUTD's Open House on 4th March 2017.
