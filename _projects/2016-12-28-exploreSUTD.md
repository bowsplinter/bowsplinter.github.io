An iOS and Android application developed for SUTD Admissions Office to provide information and attract potential students to SUTD. We pitched for and won the contract to develop the application which will be released to the public during Open House on 4th March 2017. The application was built using Ionic 2 framework with a backend system in Ruby on Rails.

Looking at teenagers shortened attention span, we built an application that is primarily focused on engaging them, with an unique Pokemon GO-esque feature, which allows students to go on a treasure hunt around school to collect collectibles which can later be redeemed for prizes.
