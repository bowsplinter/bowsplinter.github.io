[3DDJ](http://www.3dsampling.net/) is a research collaboration with SUTD DManD. It aims to explore the uses of a [multi-material 3D voxel printer](http://www.stratasys.com/3d-printers/production-series/connex3-systems) while sampling from nature.

I conceptualized a novel method for creating 3D objects making use of only 2D images. One image is the input for material distribution and another image is the input for height. The new object has the material properties of the first image and the texture of the second image. I implemented the program in **MATLAB**, due to its fast matrix multiplication capabilities. The program outputs the 3D object in the required format for the voxel printer.

To showcase this method in use, the skin of the a manta ray and the lamellae of a mushroom were used.

The result:

On Nov 2016, FabCafe invited our group to hold a workshop at ArtScience Museum. Geared to the public, it was an introduction to voxel printing technology. I gave a talk explaining the new method and its implementation. We guided the participants to create their own 3D models using our workflow, which were printed using the voxel printer.
